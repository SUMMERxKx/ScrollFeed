# ScrollFeed - Quick Setup Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Free Guardian API Key
1. Visit [The Guardian Open Platform](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/)
2. Click "Register for a developer key"
3. Fill out the form (describe as "personal news reader project")
4. Check your email and copy your API key

**Note:** The Guardian API is completely free with no rate limits for non-commercial use!

### Step 2: Configure the App
Open `src/App.jsx` (line 14) and replace the API key with your actual key.

**Note:** Keep your key private - use `.env` for production (see below).

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Run the App
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## ‚ú® Features to Try

1. **Enter a location** - Type any city or region in the search box
2. **Browse news** - See articles from the past 2 days for that location
3. **Click articles** - Read full stories on The Guardian website
4. **Filter results** - Use the search bar to find specific topics

6. **Refresh** - Get the latest updates for your location
7. **Dark mode** - Your system theme is automatically detected

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Using Environment Variables (Recommended for production)

Create a `.env` file:

```

Update `src/App.jsx`:
```javascript
const GUARDIAN_API_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_GUARDIAN_API_KEY || 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
```

This keeps your API key secure and separate from your code.

## üì± Building for Production

npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist/` folder.

3. Click "Add New" ‚Üí "Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Add your API key as environment variable: `VITE_GUARDIAN_API_KEY`
6. Click "Deploy"

That's it! Your app will be live in ~2 minutes.

## üêõ Troubleshooting
